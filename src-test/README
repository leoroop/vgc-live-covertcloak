This is a temporal folder for testing the new features


August 20, 2023:

main.py, colors.py and utils.py files are the main skeleton of the covertcloak.
For now it covers the following screens: Pick, Pokémon, Change Pokémon, Choose Command, Choose Target.
This script creates a buffer of 5 frames, so the Hide Window is 5 frames behind the Cleanfeed. This allows to cover retrogradely the previous frames that are not being recognized as long as there is a "fade in" (opacity) of the game overlays.
This script also keeps hiding 10 frames after the image recognition ends. This is because the "fade out" (opacity) of the game overlays.
Colors are only calibrated for my capture card. They maybe should be changed manually to match your capture card color processing. (TODO calibrator)
Checkpoints coordinates are meassured only in 1920x1080. This is because there are several checkpoints of only 4 pixels. So lower resolutions make it even more difficult to be accurate. It is not impossible as long as there is a step blurring the frame before looking for the checkpoint. (Lower resolutions are still a TODO thing)
